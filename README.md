# p-adic-poly

Any function F_p^n -> F_p can be uniquely expressed by a polynomial
on n-variables of degree less than p with respect to each variable.
This can be constructively proved since the delta functions are expressed in that way and 
any function is a linear combination of the delta functions.
However, it is not trivial to obtain a concice presentation which does not involve a lot of cancellation of terms.
This script computes the polynomial expression of any function which is defined as a procedure of Maple.
The polynomial expression has an application in homomorphic encryption.
